    >>> # 1. All the data from the table 5 is copied to table number 3.
    >>> # Table 5 now contains only a symbolic link to table 3, while table 3
    >>> # has 2 rows. 2 becomes the new maximum size.
    >>> # 2. 2 and 4 are merged in the same way as 3 and 5.
    >>> # 3. We are trying to merge 1 and 4, but 4 has a symbolic link pointing
    >>> # to 2, so we actually copy all the data from the table number 2 to
    >>> # the table number 1, clear the table number 2 and put a symbolic link
    >>> # to the table number 1 in it. Table 1 now has 3 rows of data,
    >>> # and 3 becomes the new maximum size.
    >>> # 4. Traversing the path of symbolic links from 4 we have 4 → 2 → 1,
    >>> # and the path from 5 is 5 → 3. So we are actually merging tables
    >>> # 3 and 1. We copy all the rows from the table number 1 into the table
    >>> # number 3, and now the table number 3 has 5 rows of data, which is
    >>> # the new maximum.
    >>> # 5. All tables now directly or indirectly point to table 3, so all
